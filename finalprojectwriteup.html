            <h1>This is my final project documentation!</h1>
            <h2><u>Concept Description:</u></h2>
            <p>Pet me for flowers is a cute interactive display to help attract attention of passerbys at makerfairs. It can also be
                used for advertising the vendor's product. It's essentially a duck plushie that is connected to a linear actuator ontop of a box,
                with a flower hidden inside it (also attached to another linear actuator). There is a capacitive sensor on the plushie so when you pet it, 
                it does a little jump, and out of the box emerges a lotus flower.

                            These are all the materials I used: Arduino (5V), breadboard, jump wires, alligator clip, two microservos, 1 megaohm resistor and 
                            foil for capacitive touch, yarn (to make plushie), plywood (to lasercut box), some paper, and access to filament to 3D print the actuator.
                            Everything in this project was built from scratch. We have two servos (one attached to pin 10 that controls the flowers, one to pin 11 that controls the duck; 
                            they are operating independently) that are mounted on an actuator. For the resistor, since a capacitor is created from two conductors with a dielectric between them,
                            the capacitance of the capacitor is determined by the surface area of the conductors and the distance between them. Using a higher resistance means that you can use a smaller capacitance,
                            (be further away from the sensor) to get the same results as if you were close to the sensor. I used the biggest resistor value I had since my plushie would be covering
                            most of the sensor area. The schematic and circuitry below will further detail how everything was implemented together.
