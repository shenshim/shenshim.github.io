            <h1>Assignment 4 was Libaries!</h1>
            <h2><u>Project Description:</u></h2>
            <p>This project required us to create a circuit with 2 libraries, and both and input and output component.
                Here you will find the firmware code, schematic/photos and super cute clip of the circuit; 
                run with the help from Douglas (the kitty assistant). 
            </p>

                <p> Look at Doug holding down that wire! Very helpful- but how did we get here? First we have to gather
                    our hardware. This project was built using the Arduino, the ultrasonic sensor, a microservo,
                    and a handful of jumpwires.

            <p> The circuit was designed to mimic an automatic door, where if you get close to it, it "opens". In this case,
                the servo is turning at an angle of 70 degrees. I used the Arduino's servo library and ultrasonic library by Erick Simoes
                for more efficient calculations (<a href=” ”>https://github.com/ErickSimoes/Ultrasonic</a>).

            <p>-Here is the code snippet-
                <div class = "codebox">
                    <pre>

    // include libraries 
    #include <Servo.h>
    #include <Ultrasonic.h>
    // class servo, for controlling servo motor
    Servo servo;
    // class called ultrasonic that sets trig and echo pins of sensor to pins 10 and 11
    Ultrasonic ultrasonic(10, 11);
    #define trig 10
    #define echo 11
    //declare integever variable called angle, which is initialized at 0, which is the starting position of our servo motor. 
    int angle = 0;
    
    
    void setup() {
    // attach servo motor to pin 8
      servo.attach(8);
    // set baud rate for serial communication at 9600
      Serial.begin(9600);
    // trig pin for ultrasonic sensor to OUTPUT
      pinMode(trig, OUTPUT);
    // echo pin for ultrasonic sensor as INPUT
      pinMode(echo, INPUT);
    }
    
    void loop() {
    // we'll use duration and distance to store duration and distance of a pulse.
    // obtained by calling the read() method of Ultrasonic library!
      digitalWrite(trig, LOW);
      digitalWrite(echo, LOW);
      delayMicroseconds(5);
    // give 5 microseconds for trigger and echo to be set from LOW to HIGH
      digitalWrite(trig, HIGH);
      delayMicroseconds(10);
    // set trig pin to high and wait 10 microseconds for calculation
      digitalWrite(trig, LOW);
    // sets tig pin back to low. 
    
    // from the calculations made above, this line measures pulse and duration of the sensor 
    // which is then converted to cm by the ultrasonic sensor. 
      duration = pulseIn(echo, HIGH);
      distance = ultrasonic.read();
    
    // if the distance measured is less than 10cm 
      if (distance < 10) {
    // the angle variable will be set to 70 degrees
        angle = 70;
    // and the system will write "door's open." on our serial monitor
        Serial.println("door's open.");
    // wit 500 miliseconds
        delay(500);
    
      } else {
    // but if distance is greater than 10cm, angle remains at 0. 
        angle = 0;
        delay(500);
    
      }
    // call write method in servo library to display angle stored in angle variable
      servo.write(angle);
    // prints string distance: to serial monitor
      Serial.print("distance: ");
    // prints value stored in distance to serial monitor
      Serial.print(distance);
    // prints string cm to serial monitor
      Serial.println("cm");
    }

    Thanks for viewing!
