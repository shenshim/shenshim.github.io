            <h1>Assignment 1 was BLINK!</h1>
            <h2><u>Project Description:</u></h2>
            <p>This project required us to create a circuit with atleast 3 LEDs
                blinking in a pattern. Here you will find the firmware code,
                schematic, resistor calculations, and a short video of the circuit!
            </p>

                <p>It's pretty snazzy I must say! But how did we get here? First we have to gather
                    our hardware. This project was built using the Arduino, breadboad, 5 LEDs (2 Green,
                    2 Red, 1 Blue), ohm resistors, and jump wires. Then I did some
                    some calculations to measure resistor voltage, desired currents, and
                    required resistance. The calculations for those can be found below:

            <img src="Blink assets/calculations blink.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
            <p> Based on our calculations, the nearest resistor value available in our kit is
                250 or 330 ohms. I decided to use the 330 ohm resistors. We can draw our schematic now!

// set corresponding LED colors to their designated ports

int Red = 8;

// define ports 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 as outputs for each LED/pin

  pinMode(Red, OUTPUT);

}

void loop() {

// continuous running of code
// HIGH = voltage level; turns LED ON
// LOW = voltage level; turn LED OFF
// Delay 500 = wait for 0.5 seconds.
// Linear blinking pattern.

  digitalWrite(Red, HIGH);
